### KBB Project Parent Report

**Disclaimer: The following report was design to test for seeing, hearing, mental health, language, and thinking ability. The scores from these test can point to potential problems but they are not diagnostic. Any problems that may be present should be followed up with more testing to confirm. **

This is a report for the child:

```{r, demographic information as Mei suggested,  results='asis', echo = FALSE}
data <- full_data %>%
  filter(Child_ID == ID_num)


cat('\n - ID:', ID_num, '\n')
cat('\n - Age:',data$Age,'\n')
cat('\n - Sex:',data$Sex,'\n')

```



```{r create a function to report standardized scores as a percentile results}
# We decided on the following categories
# Bottom 5% → "Lowest individuals."
# 5% to 20% → "Below average individuals."
# 20% to 80% → "Average individuals."
# 80% to 95% → "Above average individuals."
# Top 5% → "Highest individuals."

ss_to_perctl_fun <- function(x) {
  if (is.na(x)) {
    return(NA_character_)  # Ensures NA is returned as a character
  }
  
  if (x >= 1.645) {
    return("Top 5% - Highest")
  } else if (x >= 0.84) {
    return("80-95% - Above average")
  } else if (x >= -0.84) {
    return("20-80% - Average")
  } else if (x >= -1.645) {
    return("5-20% - Below average")
  } else {
    return("Bottom 5% - Lowest")
  }
}


```

### Possible Areas of Developmental Disability According to the Screener

Below we will show whether there were any reported difficulties for the Child Functioning Module screener (CFM), which were the first questions asked before joining the study. Also, we will report a risk for having epilepsy. 

```{r reporting potential difficulties in pretty font,  results='asis', echo = FALSE}
# Report the CFM domains that at least some difficulty was reported
Num_Diff <- data.frame(Domains = do.call(c, str_split(data$KBB_CFM_DD_type, "; ")))

if(sum(is.na(Num_Diff)) == 1) {
  
  cat('\n - No difficulties were reported for the CFM \n')
  
} else {
  
  Num_Diff %>%
    mutate(`Reported Difficulties` = "Yes") %>%
    kbl() %>%
    kable_minimal(full_width = F)
  
}

if(data$Epilepsy == "Yes") {
  cat('\n - A potential risk for having epilepsy \n')
} else {
  cat('\n - No potential risk for having epilepsy \n\n\n')
  
}



```




#### 1. Eyesight

The score for **seeing ability** Is expressed as a fraction. The top number is the distance at which your child can see a letter or symbol. The bottom number is the distance at which the average child can see that same letter or symbol. Larger numbers at the bottom of the fraction means that the child has poorer vision.

Summary Examples:

- 20/16 = better than normal vision
- 20/20 = normal vision
- 20/25 = slightly worse than normal, but still functional
- 20/40 = acceptable for daily activities, but not ideal
- 20/100 = significant vision impairment
- 20/200 and worse = legally blind or very poor vision

```{r physical data eyes}
# Obtain the variables of interest
Eyes <- data %>%
  select(Left.eye:Both.Eyes)

# Rename the variables
names(Eyes) <- c("Left Eye", "Right Eye", "Acceptable Status", "Both Eyes")

# Print the tables
Eyes %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)

```

#### 2. Hearing

The score for **hearing ability** is represented as a decibel (dB; “loudness”), which is a number that represents how loud the sound needs to be for the child to hear it; larger numbers mean there are more problems with hearing.

Summary Examples:

- -10 to -1 - better than normal hearing:
- 0 to 20 dB - normal hearing:
- 21 to 40 dB - mild hearing loss: may have trouble hearing soft sounds like whispers
- 41 to 70 dB - moderate hearing loss: may have difficulty hearing normal conversations
- 71 to 90 dB - severe hearing loss: may only hear loud speech or sound
- 91 dB+ - profound hearing loss: may not be able to hear everyday sounds without hearing aids
  

```{r physical data hearing}
# Extract variables for left hearing ability
Ears_L <- data %>%
  select(`1000Hz_dB` = `1000Hz_Left_dB`,
         `2000Hz_dB` = `2000Hz_Left_dB`,
         `4000Hz_dB` = `4000Hz_Left_dB`,) %>%
  mutate(Ear = "Left")

# Extract variables for right hearing ability
Ears_R <- data %>%
  select(`1000Hz_dB` = `1000Hz_Right_dB`,
         `2000Hz_dB` = `2000Hz_Right_dB`,
         `4000Hz_dB` = `4000Hz_Right_dB`) %>%
  mutate(Ear = "Right")

# Create a function for overall hearing ability
hearing_ability_fun <- function(dat){
  # Calculate a mean from the provided vars
  RowMean = rowMeans(Ears_R[,1:3], na.rm = T)
  
  # Given it a rating
  status <- case_when(
    RowMean < 0 ~ "Better than normal",
    RowMean <= 20 ~ "Normal hearing",
    RowMean <= 40 ~ "Mild hearing loss",
    RowMean <= 70 ~ "Moderate hearing loss",
    RowMean <= 90 ~ "Severe hearing loss",
    RowMean > 90 ~ "Extremly severe hearing loss")
  
  # Return the hearing status
  return(status)
}

# Add this variable information
Ears_L$Status <- hearing_ability_fun(Ears_L[,1:3])
Ears_R$Status <- hearing_ability_fun(Ears_R[,1:3])

# Bind information into one dataset
Ears <- rbind(Ears_L, Ears_R) %>% select(Ear, everything())

# Print out the table
Ears %>%
  kbl(caption = "") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)
```

#### 3. Assessments

Scores for each child on these tests (mental health, verbal ability, cognitive ability) are designed to give information about how the child did compared to other children in the study of a similar age. The age range for each of these tests changes depending on what is recommended by the authors of that test or how similar scores for certain age groups look like. Below are the scores for your child for these different tests, the number of children your child was compared to, and a rank that tells you how well the child did compared to them.


#### Mental Health: Emotional, Behavioral, and Social problems

The ASEBA Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) is a popular test for a child's emotional, behavioral and social problems. There are two versions, one for children 3-6 years or age and another for older children aged 6-18 years. This test has more than 100 questions, where the frequency of a specific problem is reported as "not true", "somewhat or sometimes true", or "very true or often true". Therefore, a **high score** on this test means the child has **more difficulty controlling their emotions or behaviors**. 


```{r reporting ASEBA}
# Check which ASEBA the child has data for
if(sum(ID_num %in% CBCL3_6$Child_ID) != 0) {
  id_CBCL3_6 <- filter(CBCL3_6, Child_ID == ID_num)
  CBCL_score <- round(CBCL3_6$standardized_score,2)
  CBCL_rank <-  ss_to_perctl_fun(CBCL_score)
  CBCL_n <- id_CBCL3_6$group_n
  
  } else if(sum(ID_num %in% CBCL6_18$Child_ID) != 0){
    id_CBCL6_18 <- filter(CBCL6_18, Child_ID == ID_num)
    CBCL_score <- round(id_CBCL6_18$standardized_score,2)
    CBCL_rank <-  ss_to_perctl_fun(CBCL_score)
    CBCL_n <- id_CBCL6_18$group_n
  
  } else {
    CBCL_score <- "NA"
    CBCL_rank <-  "Unable to Provide"
    CBCL_n <- "NA"
    
}
  
# Report the results as a table
cbind(`Number of Children` = CBCL_n, `Child Score` = CBCL_score, `Child Rank` = CBCL_rank) %>%
  kbl(caption = "") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)
  
```


#### Receptive Vocabulary

**Receptive vocabulary** refers to a person’s ability to understand words they hear or read. It reflects how well someone can comprehend spoken or written language, even if they don’t actively use those words in their own speech or writing. High scores indicate the child is able to understand spoken words well while lower scores indicate difficulty with this. Lower scores could indicate struggling with following directions, reading comprehension, or general communication. **Low scores** could also indicate **language delay**, **learning disability**, or **hearing issues**.

```{r reporting on receptive vocabulary}
# Check for their data
if(sum(ID_num %in% RV$Child_ID) != 0) {
  id_RV <- filter(RV, Child_ID == ID_num)
  RV_score <- round(id_RV$standardized_score,2)
  RV_rank <-  ss_to_perctl_fun(RV_score)
  RV_n <- id_RV$group_n
  
  } else {
    RV_score <- "NA"
    RV_rank <-  "Unable to Provide"
    RV_n <- "NA"
    
  }


# Report the results as a table
cbind(`Number of Children` = RV_n, `Child Score` = RV_score, `Child Rank` = RV_rank) %>%
  kbl(caption = "") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)
```


#### General Cognitive Ability (Reasoning and Memory)

Three assessments were used to capture cognitive ability in the child. These measures are **Pattern Reasoning**, **Triangles**, and **Letter & Digit Span**. Scores for each of these measures indicate how well they performed- with **higher scores representing better performance**. 

- **Pattern Reasoning**: It is an index of fluid intelligence- requires the child to recognize patterns, solve problems, and think logically without requiring experiences to guide them.

- **Triangles**: It is an index of visual spatial processing. It Assesses the ability to mentally manipulate shapes and recognize geometric patterns. 

- **Letter & Digit Span**; A common measure of working memory. It measures the ability to hold and manipulate information in short-term memory. It is essentially for learning and problem solving. 


```{r scoring IQ measures}
# Check for their data
if(sum(ID_num %in% PR$Child_ID) != 0) {
  id_PR <- filter(PR, Child_ID == ID_num)
  PR_score <- round(id_PR$standardized_score,2)
  PR_rank <-  ss_to_perctl_fun(PR_score)
  PR_n <- id_PR$group_n
  
  } else {
    PR_score <- "NA"
    PR_rank <-  "Unable to Provide"
    PR_n <- "NA"
    
  }


# Check for their data
if(sum(ID_num %in% TR$Child_ID) != 0) {
  id_TR <- filter(TR, Child_ID == ID_num)
  TR_score <- round(id_TR$standardized_score,2)
  TR_rank <-  ss_to_perctl_fun(TR_score)
  TR_n <- id_TR$group_n
  
  } else {
    TR_score <- "NA"
    TR_rank <-  "Unable to Provide"
    TR_n <- "NA"
    
  }



# Check for their data
if(sum(ID_num %in% LDS$Child_ID) != 0) {
  id_LDS <- filter(LDS, Child_ID == ID_num)
  LDS_score <- round(id_LDS$standardized_score,2)
  LDS_rank <-  ss_to_perctl_fun(LDS_score)
  LDS_n <- id_LDS$group_n
  
  } else {
    LDS_score <- "NA"
    LDS_rank <-  "Unable to Provide"
    LDS_n <- "NA"
    
  }

# Generate a table with all of this information
cog_dat <- data.frame(x1 = c(PR_n, TR_n, LDS_n),
                      x2 = c(PR_score, TR_score, LDS_score),
                      x3 = c(PR_rank, TR_rank, LDS_rank))

# Rename the dataset
names(cog_dat) <- c("Number of Children", "Child Score", "Child Rank")
rownames(cog_dat) <- c("Pattern Reasoning", "Triangles", "Letter & Digit Span")

# Report the results as a table
cog_dat %>%
  kbl(caption = "") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)
